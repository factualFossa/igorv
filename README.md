## What

The weblog hosted at [factualfossa.github.io/igorv](https://github.com/factualFossa/igorv) showcases an assortment of previously-private notes that have been expanded to cover a wide array of topics. It functions as a mirror for the Substack page, providing the distinct advantage of a more dynamic nature with regular and generally moderate updates to its content.

## Why

The main goals of this endeavor are twofold: first, to construct a knowledge base that interconnects diverse ideas, and second, to serve as a creative playground for writing and content creation. The utilization of tools such as OpenAI's GPT may assist in these creative processes, fostering an environment for experimentation and exploration.
